I'm Janelle Gatchalian, a content strategist and UX designer from Los Angeles, CA. My bachelor's degree, from Smith College, is in art history. I've been drawn to UX because I'm a natural at listening, observing, and researching.

At the Getty, I work on books for students and scholars, creating immersive reading experiences and new ways of experiencing visual and auditory material.

My overarching goal is to connect with other mission-driven organizations and the open-source community. In order to learn more about the GitHub workflow and static site generators, recommendations that grew out of the [Online Scholarly Catalogue Initiative (OSCI),](https://www.getty.edu/publications/osci-report/) I created this site by leveraging a template for the static site generator, Jekyll, and the server, GitHub Pages.

I've developed my knowledge of UX design and agile UX through the Nielsen Norman Group, IDEO, and UCLA Extension. UCLA Extension recently [interviewed me](http://visual.uclaextension.edu/interview-with-ux-student-janelle-gatchalian/) about my experience in their UX program.
