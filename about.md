I'm Janelle Gatchalian, a content strategist and UX designer from Los Angeles, CA. My bachelor's degree, from Smith College, is in art history. I've been drawn to UX because I'm a natural at listening, observing, and researching.

At the Getty, I work on books for students and scholars, creating immersive reading experiences and new ways of experiencing visual and auditory material.

My overarching goal is to connect with other mission-driven organizations and the open-source community.

I've developed my knowledge of UX design and agile UX through the Nielsen Norman Group, IDEO, and UCLA Extension. UCLA Extension recently [interviewed me](http://visual.uclaextension.edu/interview-with-ux-student-janelle-gatchalian/) about my experience in their UX program.
