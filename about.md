I'm Janelle Gatchalian, a content strategist and UX designer from Los Angeles, CA. My bachelor's degree, from Smith College, is in art history. I've been drawn to UX because I'm a natural at listening, observing, and researching.

At the Getty, I work on books for students and scholars, creating immersive reading experiences and new ways of experiencing visual and auditory material.

I've developed my knowledge of UX design and agile UX through the Nielsen Norman Group, IDEO, and UCLA Extension. Read a student interview of me here: <http://visual.uclaextension.edu/interview-with-ux-student-janelle-gatchalian/>.
