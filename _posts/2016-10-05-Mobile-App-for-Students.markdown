description: an app for students to learn about musical and performance scores.

**Client:** The Getty, Los Angeles, CA <br>
**Clientâ€™s mission:** to advance our understanding of the visual arts. Its research institute has over 12,000 linear feet of
manuscripts and archives. One of the ways the collection makes its way into the world is through books. For many years, these books have taken the form of beautiful illustrated print books. <br>
**What the team cares about:** The content (musical and performance scores) is mystifying; a multisensory presentation of the content would invite students to learn about it. The app also seeks to demonstrate how musical and performance scores can be performed, experienced, and connected to other scores. <br>
**My role:** working documentation and iterations of personas, journey maps, high-fidelity wireframes, clickable prototypes, wire flows, analytics, and low-fidelity sketches. <br>
