#### Project Brief
**Client:** The Getty, Los Angeles, CA.
<br>

**Clientâ€™s mission:** to advance our understanding of the visual arts. Its research institute has over 12,000 linear feet of manuscripts and archives. One of the ways the collection makes its way into the world is through books. For many years, these books have taken the form of illustrated print books.
<br>

**What the team cares about:** The content (musical and performance scores) is mystifying, even for people who know how to read music; a multisensory presentation of the content would invite students to learn more. The app also seeks to demonstrate how musical and performance scores can be performed, experienced, and connected to other scores.
<br>

**My role:** working documentation and iterations of personas, journey maps, low-fidelity sketches, high-fidelity wireframes, clickable prototypes, wire flows, and analytics. <br>
<br>
<br>

#### Sample Deliverables

##### **A journey map of the student Jean Kim, one persona**

#### Results

User insights from these low-fidelity prototypes inform future iterations of the app.
