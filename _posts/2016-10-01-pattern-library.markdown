**Assignment:** As part of the UX II: Iteration course at UCLA Extension, I've designed a pattern library based on [atomic design principles.](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)

**Client:** members of a design team (project managers, designers, developers, UX researchers) should be able to share a pattern library <br>

**My role:** building a Pattern Library as a Jekyll site; breaking up parts of the library into templates, modules, components, and elements; wireframes <br>

The pattern library is hosted on [my GitHub repository.](http://janelle-gatchalian.github.io/patternlibrary)
