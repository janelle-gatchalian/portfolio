#### Project Brief

**Assignment:** As part of the UX II: Iteration course at UCLA Extension, I designed a pattern library based on [atomic design principles.](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
<br>

**Client:** members of a design team (project managers, designers, developers, UX researchers) should be able to consult a pattern library so that they are not reinventing the wheel each time they begin a new project.
<br>

**My role:** building a pattern library using a Jekyll template and hosting the site on GitHub pages; organizing the library into parts such as templates, modules, components, and elements; wireframes.
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Deliverables

The [pattern library](https://janelle-gatchalian.github.io/patternlibrary) is hosted on [my GitHub repository.](https://github.com/janelle-gatchalian/patternlibrary)
