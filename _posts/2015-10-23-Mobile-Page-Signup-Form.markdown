description: a landing page to turn followers into email subscribers
---
**Client:** Kristen Jones, life coach, [You Go! Girl Coaching](http://yougogirlcoaching.net) <br>
**Clientâ€™s mission:** to build a list of subscribers for her new email marketing campaign <br>
**What the client base cares about:** Kristen's current followers have viewed her five-minute inspirational video series "Weekly Dose of Vitamin K" on Facebook over 500 times. An email subscription would make sure her followers do not miss out on content. <br>
**My role:** Kristen and I designed a landing page and connected it to her Facebook account. Users were directed to the landing page before the video content was displayed. <br>
**Metrics:** Conversion to subscription increased by 80%. The first name field was also permanently added to her website.
