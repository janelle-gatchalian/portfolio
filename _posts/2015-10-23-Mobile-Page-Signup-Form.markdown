#### Project Brief

**Client:** Kristen Jones, life coach, [You Go! Girl Coaching](http://yougogirlcoaching.net).
<br>

**Clientâ€™s goal:** to build a list of subscribers for her upcoming email marketing campaign.
<br>

**What the client base cares about:** Kristen's Facebook followers view her five-minute inspirational video series "Weekly Dose of Vitamin K" on Facebook at least 500 times per week. An email subscriber base would make sure her followers do not miss out on content and allow her to reach them consistently.
<br>

**My role:** Kristen and I designed a landing page for mobile and desktop and connected it to her Facebook account. Users were then directed to a landing page before her video content was displayed.
<br>
<br>
<br>
