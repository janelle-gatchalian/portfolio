**Client:** staff of The Getty, Los Angeles, CA <br>
**Human-Centered Research Question:** How might we help our colleagues make easy, quick, and budget-friendly meals? <br>
**Why is this important?** limited time of staff, no designated spaces for preparing lunches, lack of variety in staff cafeteria, inability to go off-site for lunch. <br>
**My role:** My colleague, Jackie and I, and I came up with the research question. Then we both worked on user interviewing and research, mapping and sorting, voting on solutions, and prototyping <br>

**Three main insights**

<br>
**We used the insights to brainstorm and vote on solutions. We invited two other colleagues to our design-thinking sprint.** <br>

#### **We tested idea 1: meal sharing.** <br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
#### **We tested idea 2: a Facebook group for sharing personally tested recipes.** <br>
<br>

#### **Results:** <br>
Although we work together, we learned that we also need to know one another personally before we share food. This Facebook group was the initial step in building a community amongst our colleagues.
Ideally, over time, we would be able to launch new initiatives such as meal planning, and eventually, meal sharing.
