#### Project Brief
**Client:** staff of The Getty, Los Angeles, CA. <br>

**Human-Centered Research Question:** How might we help our colleagues make easy, quick, and budget-friendly meals? <br>

**Why is this important?** limited time of staff, no designated spaces for preparing lunches, lack of variety in staff cafeteria, inability to go off-site for lunch. <br>

**My role:** My colleague, Jackie and I, and I came up with the research question. Then we both worked on user interviewing and research, mapping and sorting, voting on solutions, and prototyping.
<br>
<br>
<br>

##### **Three main insights emerged from our human-centered research.**

<br>
<br>
<br>

##### **We used these insights to brainstorm and vote on possible solutions. We invited two other colleagues to our design-thinking sprint.**

green dots= most innovative <br>
yellow dots= most realistic <br>

<br>

##### **We tested possible solution #1 by surveying users about meal sharing.** <br>

<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
##### **We tested possible solution #2 by creating a Facebook group for sharing personally tested recipes.** <br>

#### Testing results <br>
Although we work together, we learned that we also need to know one another personally before we share food. Most of our colleagues were hesitant to pursue meal-sharing plans with people they barely knew. This Facebook group was the initial step in building a community amongst our colleagues. <br>
<br>
Ideally, over time, we would be able to launch new initiatives such as meal planning, and eventually, meal sharing.
