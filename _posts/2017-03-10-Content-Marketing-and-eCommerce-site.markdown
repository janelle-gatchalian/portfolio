<br>

#### Project Brief

**Assignment:** As part of the UX II: Iteration course at UCLA Extension, I designed an eCommerce site that combines content marketing in the experience.
<br>

**Client:** bakers who are looking for trusted recipes and on-the-go foodies who are looking for freshly made baked goods.
<br>

**My role:** working documentation and iterations of personas, low-fidelity sketches and wireframes for the following pages: <br>
* home page <br>
* content marketing landing pages <br>
* content marketing article category pages <br>
* content marketing article page with related articles and product cross-links <br>
* product landing page <br>
* product category page <br>
* product detail page <br>
* cart and checkout pages <br>
<br>
<br>
