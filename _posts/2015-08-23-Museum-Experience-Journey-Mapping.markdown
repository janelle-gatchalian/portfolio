**Client:** The Getty, Los Angeles, CA <br>
**Clientâ€™s mission:** to reduce pain points in the visitor experience. <br>
**My role:** As a member of the organization's audience experience group, I worked in a team to outline a visitor's experience, touch points during the visit, and overall ease of dealing with each step in the experience. The persona I worked on was Dennis, a facilitator and task-completing visitor. <br>
