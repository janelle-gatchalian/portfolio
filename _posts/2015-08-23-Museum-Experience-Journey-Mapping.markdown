#### Project Brief

**Client:** The Getty, Los Angeles, CA.
<br>

**Clientâ€™s mission:** to reduce pain points in the visitor experience.
<br>

**My role:** As a member of the organization's audience experience group, I helped create a journey map outlining a visitor's experience, touch points during the visit, and overall ease of dealing with each step in the experience. The persona I worked on was Dennis, a facilitator and task-completing visitor.
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Sample Deliverable

##### **A journey map of the facilitator and task-completing visitor, Dennis**

yellow dots= satisfactory <br>
green dots= easy <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

#### Results
Our group created journey maps for five different personas. These journey maps inform our tram audio recording and wayfinding messaging across the Getty.
